# Checkpoint 1 and the general description of the project

## Overall idea

I am looking at load balancing, possibly in edge clusters, as soft real time system. This system might have deadlines for different processes or for processes generated by certain sources. But may not have any deadline requirements for many others.

- Look at the processing of various processes of the system and form different clusters to form a loose definition of different states of the system.

  - Advantage is that this can allow us define a finite number of states for any system.
  - A first attempt can select number of clusters based on number of different requests that can be made to the system. However, higher dimensional cluster like a combination of request types can also be considered.

- Once a determination of states are made, use reinforcement learning to find an optimal scheduling solution that looks to reduce tardiness given a generic optimization goal.
  - Optimization goal can be provided in terms of a general service time.
  - tardiness := max[0, (t - d)]
    1. t -> total time spent in the system by a process
    2. d -> deadline for the process. If the process does not have a specific deadline then d defaults to the optimization goal.
